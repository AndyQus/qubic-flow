# Changelog

All notable changes to QubicFlow are documented here.

---

## [0.1.7] — 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- Tax report returned HTTP 500 on Umbrel OS — `OpeningPosition` was missing from `Base.metadata` registration, so the `opening_positions` table was never created on fresh deployments via the `create_all` fallback path
- Error logging added to the tax report endpoint (`logger.exception`) for better diagnostics in production

### Changed
- Balance is now refreshed immediately in the background when a wallet is updated/saved (previously only on wallet creation)
- Balance scheduler confirmed at 1-hour interval
