## Features

- **Unlimited wallets** — PRIVATE and BUSINESS, manageable via the UI
- **Dual-node support** — Standard RPC (`rpc.qubic.org`) **and** BOB Node (`bobnet.qubic.li`); the best available node is chosen automatically
- **Event sync** — automatically every 60 seconds; RPC nodes via `getEventLogs` (uses `transactionHash` **directly as primary key** — the same 60-character ID shown in the Qubic Explorer), BOB nodes via `POST /getQuTransferForIdentity`. SC-internal events without `transactionHash` fall back to the numeric `logId` (the 16-character `logDigest` is then the Explorer ID for those events)
- **TX sync** — transfer transactions via Qubic Archiver API, deduplicated against events; tries multiple field names (`transactionId`, `txId`, `id`, `digest`, `hash`) and prefers the real 60-character Qubic TxID. Stub matching: existing event rows are found by `(tick, source, destination, amount)` and updated with the real TxID (user fields like notes/labels are preserved). Chunk-based progress with checkpoint per chunk — failed chunks become a sync gap and do not reset `last_tx_tick`. Initial sync starts at `current_tick − 500,000` (archiver retention period), not at tick 1
- **Smart contract classification** — `logType=0` transfers are classified as `TX` (normal transfer) or `EVENT` (smart contract / token issuer, e.g. QX, Qearn, QMine) via address labels
- **Token dividend tracking** — Qubics received via token distributions (e.g. QMine dividends) are automatically detected: token issuer addresses are synced daily from the Qubic assets registry (`static.qubic.org`); incoming transfers from these addresses are classified as EVENTs and recorded per epoch with date, amount and EUR/USD rate
- **Manual resync** — "Refresh data" button in settings (`POST /wallets/resync-all`) resets sync counters and imports only missing records (existing data is preserved)
- **Tick-range window technique** — overcomes the 10,000-record RPC API limit via recursive halving
- **Address name resolution** — automatic resolution of Qubic addresses to tokens/labels (assets page + CSV)
- **Assets page** — overview of all smart contracts and tokens with ticker, category, decimal places, website
- **Wallet balances** — current balance per wallet is updated automatically
- **EUR/USD rates** — fetched daily from CoinGecko, cached in the database
- **Statistics panels** — Hour / Day / Epoch / Month / Year, each with current and previous period
- **Epoch view** — all epochs navigable as a wallet panel grid (label, owner, incoming Qubics incl. TX/event split, outgoing Qubics incl. EUR value); dividends from smart contract payouts and token distributions (e.g. QX shares, Qearn, QMine) are automatically detected per epoch as EVENTs; filter "All" / "With income only" plus "Show all" toggle (`?ext=1`) to show/hide empty sub-rows
- **Events table** — separate columns for TxId and Tick, each with copy button and Explorer link (`/network/tx/{id}` and `/network/tick/{tick}`); short display (5 chars) with tooltip, full value on copy/open. Only real 60-character Qubic TxIDs are shown — SC-internal events without user TX show a dash in the TxID column
- **Weekly snapshots** — every Wednesday at 12:00 UTC
- **3 animation variants** for new events: slide down, fly in, bar fade (configurable)
- **Live updates** via WebSocket (events + node status)
- **Tax reporting**:
  - FIFO, LIFO, HIFO and AVCO cost-basis methods
  - Country-specific rules (DE, AT, CH, DK, and more) — including the 1-year holding-period tax exemption (DE) and the Danish model (mandatory FIFO, gains and deductible losses reported separately without netting)
  - Income events (dividends, rewards) are taxed at receipt and enter the lot queue at market value — no double taxation on later disposal
  - Honest report currency: countries without tracked local rates (CHF, GBP, DKK, …) are calculated **and labelled** in EUR
  - Opening positions for pre-tracked balances
  - Price lookup per date directly in the UI
  - CSV and PDF export of the tax report
- **CSV export**:
  - CoinTracking format (PRIVATE wallets, comma-separated, UTF-8 BOM)
  - Koinly universal format (PRIVATE wallets)
  - Blockpit generic import format (PRIVATE wallets)
  - Tax advisor format (BUSINESS wallets, semicolon-separated, UTF-8 BOM)
  - Resolved address names in the comment field
- **Portfolio value chart** — daily QU balance × daily rate as a line chart on the statistics page (with balance on a second axis)
- **Webhook notifications** — new incoming transfers can trigger a webhook (generic JSON, Discord or ntfy format) with a minimum-amount filter, a TX/SC-event type filter (checkboxes decide which kind triggers a push) and a test button (Settings → Data); every message carries the full record with the event type on the first line
- **Token & asset holdings** — live token balances (e.g. QX shares) per wallet on the wallet detail page, resolved via the Qubic assets registry; each asset shows its current price (last QX trade in QU, from the official QX API) and the resulting value in QU and EUR/USD
- **Token/Shares portfolio view** — "QUBIC | Tokens/Shares" switch on the Wallets → Portfolio tab: token values grouped by owner, per-wallet token drilldown and the total wallet value including QUBIC (batch endpoint with server-side cache)
- **Internal transfers** — wallet-to-wallet transfers are treated as tax-neutral in exports
- **Privacy mode** — eye icon in the header masks all sensitive values app-wide: wallet addresses, balances, portfolio values, P&L, tax amounts, EUR/USD totals, and personal data fields in the tax form
- **Dashboard search & pagination** — full-text search with debounce across all events; configurable page size (10–1000) persisted in localStorage
- **Ledger import** — import wallet history from [myledger.qubic.tools](https://myledger.qubic.tools/) JSON export directly in Settings → Data
- **German / English** UI, dark / light mode
- **Tabbed settings** — `Appearance` (currency, font, theme, language, animations), `Tax` (country/method, personal/business data), `Data` (export, backup/restore, resync, ledger import); active tab is reflected in the URL query parameter (`?tab=…`)
- **Fully containerized** — a single `docker compose up --build` is all you need
- **Footer** — disclaimer banner and fixed footer with copyright, links (Qubic.org, terms, privacy) and version number

## Requirements

### Docker (recommended for production)

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (Windows / Mac / Linux)
- Docker Compose plugin — included with Docker Desktop and with the `docker-compose-plugin` package on Linux

> **Note:** The modern command is `docker compose` (with a space). The legacy `docker-compose` (with a hyphen) is outdated and may not be available on your system.

### Local Development (VSCode)

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 22+
- VSCode with the **Python** (ms-python.python) and **Debugpy** extensions

---

## Start with UmbrelOS

QubicFlow is available for [UmbrelOS](https://umbrel.com/) — the self-hosted home server OS that runs on a Raspberry Pi or any Linux machine.

**Umbrel Store Repository:** https://github.com/AndyQus/qubicflow-umbrel-store

### Install via Community App Store (available now)

1. Open the Umbrel App Store
2. Click **⋮** (top-right menu) → **Community App Stores**
3. Enter the store URL: `https://github.com/AndyQus/qubicflow-umbrel-store`
4. Click **Install** next to QubicFlow

QubicFlow will be available at `http://<your-umbrel-ip>:8080` after installation.

> **Official App Store** — A submission to the official Umbrel App Store is pending (PR #5461). Once approved, QubicFlow will be installable directly from the built-in store without adding a community source.

---

## Start with Docker

```bash
cd qubic-flow
docker compose up --build   # first start or after code changes
docker compose up -d        # subsequent starts, runs in background
docker compose down         # stop (data is preserved)
docker compose down -v      # stop + delete all data
```

> **Note:** Use `docker compose` (with a space) — the legacy `docker-compose` (with a hyphen) is outdated.

**→ Main page: http://localhost:8080**

| Service   | URL                                    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| Frontend  | http://localhost:8080                  |
| Backend   | http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health    |
| API docs  | http://localhost:8000/docs             |

> Ports are bound to `127.0.0.1` — not reachable from outside.

The backend automatically runs `alembic upgrade head` on startup — database migrations run without manual intervention.

Data is stored in the Docker volume `qubicflow-data` and persists across restarts.

### Linux / Raspberry Pi — Detailed Installation Guide

For a full step-by-step guide including Docker installation, permission fixes (important for Raspberry Pi) and troubleshooting, see:

📄 **[INSTALL_Linux.md](INSTALL_Linux.md)** (English)  
📄 **[INSTALL_Linux.de.md](INSTALL_Linux.de.md)** (Deutsch)

---

## Start in VSCode (Development)

### 1. Install dependencies (once)

```bash
# Backend
cd qubic-flow/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend
cd qubic-flow/frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Initialize the database (once / after migrations)

```bash
cd qubic-flow/backend
alembic upgrade head
```

> Run after first checkout and after every new migration.  
> Creates all tables including `events` (composite primary key), `sync_state`, `address_labels`, `wallet_balances`, `opening_positions` and more.

### 3. Start

1. Open the `qubic-flow` folder in VSCode
2. Open **Run and Debug** (`Ctrl+Shift+D`)
3. Select **"QubicFlow (Full Stack)"** at the top
4. Press **F5**

VSCode starts the backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 5173) simultaneously.  
**→ Main page: http://localhost:5173**

The Vite dev server automatically proxies `/api/...` requests to the backend (proxy in `vite.config.js`).  
Python breakpoints work directly in `.py` files.

### Individual start (optional)

```bash
# Backend only
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# Frontend only
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Node Configuration

Nodes are managed via the UI under **Settings → Nodes**.  
For live sync QubicFlow automatically selects the BOB node with the **highest tick** (furthest advanced), falling back to RPC if every BOB node is stalled. The node actually feeding live sync is shown in the connection pill (top right) and marked with a pulsing dot in the node list.

### Node Types

| Type       | Description                               | Default URL                      |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `RPC`      | Qubic Public RPC (REST)                  | `https://rpc.qubic.org`         |
| `BOB_NODE` | Qubic BOB Node (core team, REST + WS)    | `http://your-bob-node:40420`    |

### Setting up an RPC node (default)

```
URL:       https://rpc.qubic.org
Type:      RPC
Label:     Qubic RPC
Priority:  1
```

### Setting up a BOB node

```
URL:       https://bobnet.qubic.li:40420
Type:      BOB_NODE
Label:     BOB Public Node
Priority:  1
```

The BOB node uses its own REST API on port **40420** — the standard RPC endpoints (`/v1/tick-info` etc.) are **not** available there.  
QubicFlow detects the type automatically via `node_type = BOB_NODE` and uses the correct endpoints.

#### BOB endpoints used

| Endpoint                         | Method | Purpose                                |
|----------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------|
| `/status`                        | GET    | Status check, current tick             |
| `/getQuTransferForIdentity`      | POST   | QU transfers per wallet + tick range   |

#### Known limitations (BOB)

- **Timestamps** are missing in raw BOB transfer entries — QubicFlow resolves them automatically via `qubic_getTickByNumber` / `GET /tick/{tickNumber}` during sync; events imported before this existed are repaired by the 6-hourly timestamp backfill job.
- The public BOB node (`bobnet.qubic.li:40420`) is a community service with no guaranteed availability. For production use, running your own BOB node is recommended.

> Full BOB API documentation: [`docs/bob_node.md`](docs/bob_node.md)

### Node failover

The sync job (`sync_all_wallets`, every 60 s) selects the **live-sync** node using the following logic:

1. Only `is_active = 1` nodes with status ONLINE or DEGRADED are considered
2. Among the BOB nodes, the one with the **highest tick** wins (furthest advanced); **priority** is only a tiebreaker when ticks are (nearly) equal
3. If even the best BOB node lags more than `MAX_BOB_LAG` (1000) ticks behind the RPC network tip, it is treated as stalled and RPC is used for live sync (logged as a warning)
4. If no node is available, the system falls back to `QUBIC_RPC_URL` from `.env`

> Data is never lost when the active node changes: incremental sync always resumes from the persisted `last_tick`, and any range a node could not serve is backfilled via RPC or recorded as a gap and retried.

---

## Configuration (.env)

Create `backend/.env` (template: `backend/.env.example`):

```env
# Database (local: relative path, Docker: absolute path in container)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./data/qubicflow.db

# Qubic RPC
QUBIC_RPC_URL=https://rpc.qubic.org

# CoinGecko (optional: API key for higher rate limits)
COINGECKO_API_URL=https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3
COINGECKO_API_KEY=

# CORS (comma-separated origins)
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8080,http://localhost:5173

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
TZ=UTC
```

> The `.env` file is in `.gitignore` — never commit it.  
> Without `.env`, the backend and Docker container start with built-in defaults.

### Wallet address format

Qubic wallet addresses consist of **exactly 60 uppercase letters** (A–Z).  
Example: `AAAAABBBBBCCCCCDDDDDEEEEEFFFFFGGGGGHHHHHIIIIIIJJJJJKKKKKLLLLL`

## Export / Tax CSVs

### CoinTracking (PRIVATE wallets)

- Format: comma-separated, UTF-8 BOM
- Contains: deposits and withdrawals
- Internal transfers (wallet → wallet) are **automatically excluded**
- `is_internal` is calculated dynamically at export time — retroactively correct when new wallets are added
- Comment field contains resolved address names: `"Source name → Destination name"`
- Download: `GET /api/v1/export/cointracking?year=2026`

### Koinly (PRIVATE wallets)

- Koinly universal CSV format (Date, Sent/Received Amount + Currency, Net Worth, Label, TxHash)
- Reward income is labelled `reward`; internal transfers excluded
- Download: `GET /api/v1/export/koinly?year=2026`

### Blockpit (PRIVATE wallets)

- Blockpit generic import format (Date (UTC), Integration Name, Label, Outgoing/Incoming Asset + Amount, Trx. ID)
- Incoming rewards are labelled `Staking`, transfers `Deposit`/`Withdrawal`; internal transfers excluded
- Download: `GET /api/v1/export/blockpit?year=2026`

### Tax advisor (BUSINESS wallets)

- Format: semicolon-separated, UTF-8 BOM
- Contains: all transfers including internal (with type flag)
- Comment field contains resolved address names: `"Source name → Destination name"`
- Download: `GET /api/v1/export/steuerberater?year=2026`

Both exports include EUR values rounded to 2 decimal places.

## Tax Reporting

The **Tax** page calculates gains and income according to country-specific rules directly in the app.

### Configuration

Under **Settings → Tax**:

| Setting | Description                                        | Default |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Country | Tax jurisdiction (DE, AT, CH, …)                  | DE      |
| Method  | Calculation order (FIFO / LIFO / HIFO / AVCO)     | FIFO    |

### Supported countries

Available countries and their rules are provided by `GET /api/v1/tax/countries`.

- **Germany (DE):** gains from disposals held for more than 12 months are tax-free; €1,000 Freigrenze
- **Denmark (DK):** FIFO is mandatory (the method selector is locked); gains and losses are **not netted** — taxable gains and deductible losses are reported separately (Spekulationsbeskatning)
- **Report currency:** rates are tracked in EUR and USD only. The US is calculated in USD, everything else in EUR — countries with another local currency (CHF, GBP, DKK, …) are labelled honestly as EUR. Income events enter the lot queue at market value at receipt, so they are not taxed twice.

### Opening positions

If you held QU before the first recorded event, you can enter the balance as an **opening position**:

- Wallet, date, amount (QU), optional EUR/USD rate, note
- Managed via `GET/POST/DELETE /api/v1/tax/opening-positions`
- The rate for the entered date can be looked up via `GET /api/v1/tax/price?date=YYYY-MM-DD`

### Tax report

`GET /api/v1/tax/report?year=2024&mode=private&wallet_ids=…` returns:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "taxable_gains_eur": 1234.56,
    "tax_free_gains_eur": 500.00,
    "income_eur": 200.00,
    "total_disposed_qu": 50000,
    "total_acquired_qu": 100000
  },
  "disposals": [...],
  "income_events": [...],
  "meta": { "year": 2024, "mode": "private", "country": "DE", "method": "FIFO" }
}
```

The report can be downloaded directly in the UI as **CSV** or **PDF**.

## Background Jobs

| Job                       | Interval             | Description                                                               |
|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sync_all_wallets`        | every 60 seconds     | Event sync + TX sync + balance update; dynamically selects the best available node |
| `health_monitor`          | every 30 seconds     | Check node status (`/v1/tick-info` for RPC, `/status` for BOB), WebSocket broadcast |
| `retry_sync_gaps`         | every 15 minutes     | Retry unresolved sync gaps (EVENT + TX) via RPC                           |
| `check_balances`          | every hour           | Compare live RPC balance vs. computed balance; trigger targeted resync on drift |
| `backfill_tx_epochs`      | every hour           | Fill missing epoch numbers on TX records                                  |
| `refresh_donation_cache`  | every hour           | Update supporter/donation cache                                           |
| `backfill_rates`          | every 6 hours        | Fetch EUR/USD rates for events without a rate                             |
| `backfill_timestamps`     | every 6 hours        | Resolve events without a usable timestamp (old BOB imports) via tick data |
| `sync_labels`             | every 24 hours       | Address name sync (address_labels, tokens, issuances)                    |
| `weekly_snapshot`         | Wed 12:00 UTC (cron) | Save weekly aggregation snapshot                                          |

Jobs run with `max_instances=1` and `coalesce=True` — no parallel duplicate runs.

If the RPC delivers fewer records than expected for a tick range (`validForTick < to_tick`), a sync gap is created and the missing range is retried on the next run.

## Deployment & Publishing

QubicFlow is published as a multi-arch Docker image (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64) to Docker Hub and can be installed via the Umbrel Community App Store.

### Branch strategy

```
develop  →  development, tests, bugfixes  (no automatic build)
   ↓  merge
main     →  GitHub Actions starts automatically  →  Docker Hub + Umbrel Store
```

- Development happens on `develop` — unlimited commits, no build triggered
- Every merge to `main` triggers the full release process
- The `VERSION` file holds the **last released** version — the pipeline bumps the patch number itself before tagging. **Never bump `VERSION` manually**, or a release number gets skipped (double bump).

### GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`)

The workflow consists of 4 sequential jobs:

| Job                  | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tag`                | Bumps the patch version in `VERSION`, commits it, creates git tag `v{VERSION}` (skipped if it already exists) |
| `build-backend`      | Multi-arch Docker image for backend → Docker Hub                            |
| `build-frontend`     | Vue build + nginx Docker image → Docker Hub                                 |
| `update-umbrel-store`| Automatically updates version numbers in the store repo                     |
| `sync-develop`       | Pushes the version bump commit back to `develop`                            |

The `workflow_dispatch` trigger allows manual re-runs from the GitHub Actions UI if a build fails.

### Required GitHub Secrets

In the `qubic-flow` repository under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

| Secret               | Value                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Docker Hub username                                                   |
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`    | Docker Hub Personal Access Token                                      |
| `STORE_REPO_TOKEN`   | GitHub fine-grained PAT for `qubicflow-umbrel-store` (Contents: Read+Write) |

### Triggering a release

```bash
# 1. Add an entry to CHANGELOG.md (do NOT touch VERSION — the pipeline bumps it)
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "docs: changelog for next release"
git push origin develop

# 2. Merge to main → triggers the pipeline automatically
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main

# 3. Afterwards: pull develop — CI pushes the version bump commit back
git checkout develop && git pull
```
